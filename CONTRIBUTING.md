How Can I Contribute?
Reporting Bugs
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
If you’re unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
Suggesting Enhancements
Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the issues to see if there is already a suggestion.
If you find a related issue, feel free to add further information or your support for the suggestion.
If you have a new suggestion, open a new issue and provide a clear and concise description of what the enhancement is and why it would be useful.
Pull Requests
Fork the repository and create your branch from main.
If you’ve added code that should be tested, add tests.
Ensure the test suite passes.
Make sure your code lints.
Issue that pull request!

Ensure your code is well-documented and comments are used where necessary.
Additional Notes
