Project Title
Coursera GitHub Project

Project Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for calculating simple interest, showcasing the fundamental principles of programming with Python. The primary objective is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input their principal amount, interest rate, and time period, and receive an accurate calculation of the simple interest generated.

Features
User Input: Accepts principal amount, interest rate, and time in years.
Simple Interest Calculation: Computes the interest using the formula:
Simple Interest
=
Principal
×
Rate
×
Time
100
Simple Interest= 
100
Principal×Rate×Time
​
 
Output Display: Clearly presents the calculated simple interest to the user.
Error Handling: Provides user-friendly messages for invalid inputs to enhance usability.
Installation and Usage
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

git clone https://github.com/username/Coursera--github-project.git
        
    
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Coursera--github-project
        
    
Install required packages (if any): If your project requires specific Python packages, list them here along with the installation command. For example:

pip install -r requirements.txt
        
    
Run the project: To execute the script that calculates simple interest, run the following command:

python simple_interest_calculator.py
        
    
Running the Script
Once the script is running, follow these steps:

Enter the Principal Amount when prompted.
Enter the Interest Rate (as a percentage).
Enter the Time Period in years.
The script will output the calculated simple interest based on your inputs.
Example
Enter Principal Amount: 1000
Enter Interest Rate: 5
Enter Time (in years): 3
The Simple Interest is: 150.0
